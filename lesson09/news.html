      <h2>Green Buildings earn more Green</h2>
      <p><img src="images/city.jpg" alt="Green buildings are top earners" width="200" height="335" class="flt_lft">There is a growing trend in commercial real  estate to earn the EPA's Energy Star label. The award goes to the buildings  that qualify in the top 25 percent in energy performance. Tinted windows, heat  recovery systems, good insulation, high-efficiency lighting are all taken into  consideration to lower a building's energy signature. </p>
      <p>The reason is simple: tenants are attracted to  the green label achieving higher occupancy rates, increased rents and higher  profit margins for buildings that are sold. Energy Star buildings usually cost  far less to operate, reducing overhead. Qualified buildings could realize  increases in revenues of up to $120,000 for buildings with 50,000 sq ft.</p>
      <p>Soon, it may not be an option. Many  municipalities and government agencies are reviewing the need to mandate or  regulate the process of labeling energy performance in homes and commercial  buildings. Who wants to be an owner or tenant of a building that's labeled as  an &quot;Energy Waster&quot;?</p>

      <h2>Shopping green saves energy</h2>
      <p> 	<img src="images/farmersmarket.png" alt="Shop green to save energy" width="300" height="300" class="flt_rgt">Your day-to-day activities contribute more to  your energy consumption than you realize. Apart from the gas and energy you use  yourself, the businesses and retailers you patronize have to burn electricity  and fuel to supply the products and services you consume.</p>
      <p>One import thing you can do right away is to shop  locally and purchase goods manufactured in your own town or state. Today, fresh  fruits and vegetables are shipped all over the world at a high cost and waste  of millions of gallons of fuel each year. Buying from your local farmers market  can reduce energy waste. But be careful, even the vendors at the farmers market  sometimes buy non-local products when stocks are low. Verify the origin of the  products you buy.</p>
      <p>Besides cutting energy waste, buying local  benefits the local economy, promotes sustainable agriculture, and keeps your  dollars working in your own community.    </p>

      <h2>Recycling isn't always Green</h2>
      <p><img src="images/recycling.jpg" alt="Learn the pros and cons of recycling" width="300" height="177" class="flt_lft">Saving an item from the landfill and reclaiming  its raw materials may not always produce overall benefits for the environment.  For example one of the current processes for recycling paper for reuse as a  printing medium uses lots of bleach, energy and fresh water. Eliminating the  bleach produces a paper that's gray or brownish in color, which reduces it  appeal to consumers.</p>
      <p>Recycling plastics can also create as much waste  and pollution as you are trying to eliminate in the first place. Instead of  trying to recycle everything, more thought has to be put into what types of  products you want to use and what materials those products should be made from. <br>
        In many cases, trade-offs will be in order. Glass  weighs more than plastic, using more fuel to ship, but offers the advantage of  being easily recyclable. Steel and aluminum cost more to manufacture but last  longer and can usually be recycled many times.</p>

      <h2>Fireplace: Fun or Folly?</h2>
      <p>Could a romantic evening with candlelight, wine  and a roaring fire land you in jail? Or, perhaps with a ticket and hefty fine?  In some parts of the country, burning wood in home fireplaces, like day-time  sprinkling, has been banned by local governments.</p>
      <p>Open fireplaces and older wood stoves not only  pollute, they can emit 60 times as much pollution as newer models that meet or  exceed EPA standards. But, they don't just pollute outdoors, the danger can be  just as bad indoors, as well. Fireplaces and stoves produce micro-particulate  matter that can affect your lungs and health overall.</p>
      <p>So, before you light your  next fire, check with your municipal government or local EPA on the regulations  regarding fireplace use and safety. </p>
