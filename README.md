# CSS-HTML5-Lessons

This is a collection of all of the HTML5/CSS lessons I completed while learning web development with the book Adobe Dreamweaver CC Classroom in a Book. This was required for a class that I took at Grand Valley State University called Internet Media and Programming.

The repository is comprised of many lessons. Each of which is held within it's own folder. To view a directory of all of the lessons, simply open the `index.html` page and click on the desired project that you want to view.

As you progress through the book, you continue building at a website as you learn the various concept of HTML, CSS, and other web development frameworks. The final product looks like this:
